### About

I have loved creating things since I can remember. That is why, a few months after graduating as an engineer in Telecommunications and Electronics, I learned to code.

Today, I am a frontend developer at Datamart, a Chilean fintech company, and in my free time I create tools and content that make life easier for frontend developers.

I have experience troubleshooting through web applications and browser extensions using technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, TypeScript, Next.js, React, Plasmo, Astro, Tailwind and Boostrap.

Don't forget to follow me. I hope all my work is useful to you.
