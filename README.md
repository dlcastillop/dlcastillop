### About

Hi! 👋 I'm Daniel Castillo: a frontend developer and engineer.

I have loved creating things since I can remember. That is why I studied Telecommunications and Electronics engineering. However, during college I was always drawn to programming.

A few months after graduating I decided to learn how to program and a year later I started my full-time job as a developer.

Today, I am a frontend developer at Datamart, a Chilean fintech company, and in my free time I create tools and content that make life easier for developers.

Don't forget to follow me. I hope all my work is useful to you.
